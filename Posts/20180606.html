            The role of the database administrator is changing. What was once a role considered vital to an organization, is now becoming more and more obsolete as the functions of the database administrator, or DBA, are moved into the cloud.
          </p>
          <img class="card-img-top" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181316/pexels-photo-1181316.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=adult-business-data-1181316.jpg&fm=jpg" alt="photo not available">
          <br><br>
          <p>
            In the traditional sense, the DBA is known to wear a variety of hats. Their responsibilities included, but were not limited to: networking and system hardware requirements, administering the server or host operating system, virtualization layers, integration with application front-ends, storage, query optimization, and on and on. Depending on the size of the organization, the DBA might have needed to know any level or variation of the stack, in order to best support its users.
          </p>

          <p>
            While many businesses today still heavily rely on the services that the conventional DBA provides, newer, agile companies, who need to maximize the investment in their data systems have seen that moving to the cloud is cheaper and far more scalable, in terms of management and infrastructure. Platforms, such as AWS and Azure, have allowed for the removal of the manual, time-intensive work like setting up hardware or managing a cluster. Thereby freeing up resources, time, and allowing for the rise of a more specialized, data-driven form of data administration, known as the data engineer, whose role is not to focus on the systems that support the data, but on the actual data itself, how the data is accessed, and how the data is organized.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is safe to assume that this idea of subscription driven database management is here to stay. Already, government organizations are beginning to adopt cloud computing for its security and flexibility. In terms of the cost and time saved by migrating to the cloud, businesses are sure to benefit from utilizing this technology. 
          </p>

          <p>
            So how can todayâ€™s DBAs stay competitive in this constantly evolving industry? By shifting focus away from traditional hardware database management systems, and instead focusing their efforts on the features offered through these PaaS and Saas companies, In order to best utilize the tools offered in these platforms and to better leverage the data of their companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although the role of the DBA in indeed changing, it is by no means disappearing. It is maturing, along with this industry, that is still no more than a few decades old.
