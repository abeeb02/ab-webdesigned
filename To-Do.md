# Blog Tagging Feature
Goal: to add custom tags to blog posts to filter content

What will I need:
* A way to group and organize all available tags (add new tags & remove tags)
* index and search trough blog posts by tag

## steps:
# User comment Feature
* Only available for anonymous users so far (no way to log in)
	* Need a way to uniquely track user visits to site (Storing cookies on browser?)
	* Need to request permission to use cookies
	* How to prevent bots from over-commenting on site?
# What widgets can be implemented to give the blog more substance?
